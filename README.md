# redbox.js


This [web app](https://codepen.io/deadflowers/embed/bNGbNPa) recreates authentic Redbox tones via Web Audio API.

**Whats a Redbox?**

Redboxing is a old skool hacker tool to make free calls before cell phones. They exploit a classic vulnerability in the AT&T payphone network. By playing into the receiver during a dial tone (command prompt) the correct DTMF signals with proper timing, you can simulate the sounds (commands) that tell the phone system money is being deposited into the phone thus authorizing a call on the ACTS system. Any device that produces such tones intentional or not, is a redbox.

**What's redbox.js?**

Redbox JS is my modern day take on it in Javascript using the Web Audio API. It will reproduce tones necessary to authorize calls on the old AT&T ACTS system.

**Does redboxing still work?**

Yes. So I'm told at least but not for long as payphones in the US at least are being removed in most places. But if you can find a actual Bell phone not a COCOT private, I assume this would still work. Though this is posted as a novelty as an homage to 90's hacking culture.
